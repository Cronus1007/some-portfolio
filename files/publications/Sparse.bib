abstract = {Abstract:
Compressed Sensing based recovery algorithms are bounded by limitations such as recovery error and high computational requirements. This work presents a novel algorithm based on Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm for efficient and fast data recovery in wireless sensor networks. The proposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of iterations required to recover the original data in a relatively small interval of time. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm converges in a short interval of time with significantly better results as compared to the existing data recovery approaches in wireless sensor networks.}
