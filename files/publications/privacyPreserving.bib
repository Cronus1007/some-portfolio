abstract = {The use of attack-prone hardware makes designing secure schemes for data collection a complex task. Addressing the continuous threat of attacks at the aggregator nodes, this work proposes a privacy preserving secure in-network data aggregation (PPSDA) technique for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Using the pallier crypto system, a secure scheme which is resilient to false data injection attacks, is devised to compute the SUM, COUNT and MEAN at the sink node. Extensive theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms other existing aggregation approaches.}
